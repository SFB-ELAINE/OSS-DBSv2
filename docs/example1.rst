Test cases
==========

Our software repository includes a folder named "test_case" which contains six different test cases, covering a wide range of OSS-DBS software functionality. Each test case folder includes all the data required to run the simulation, along with a pre-filled input JSON file. 
Simply include the relevant input file to initiate the desired test case and start exploring the possablities of the software.

.. note::
    Some cases may not be executable on a laptop since they require more computational power.
